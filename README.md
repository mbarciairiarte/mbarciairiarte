# Hi, My name is Marcos Barcia ðŸ‘‹
### Full-stack Developer 


I'm a management engineer with a passion for development and knowledge in Java and MySQL. My background gives me a broad perspective to address technological challenges and understand business needs.

Coming from a bootcamp specialized in Java FullStack, my focus is on continuous learning and professional growth. In addition, I have experience in digital marketing, which allows me to understand how to leverage technology to drive effective strategies.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working as technical support in the IT area, for the company Totalpack and also, I'm immersed in a backend course with Node.js and MongoDB, further expanding my skill set. I look for opportunities as a trainee developer to collaborate on exciting projects and keep evolving. Let's connect and explore together!
